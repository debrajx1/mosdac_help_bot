# MOSDAC Services: RSS Feeds and Software Tools

MOSDAC provides value-added services beyond satellite data downloads to enhance usability, automate data monitoring, and support technical analysis. These services include Real-Time Syndication (RSS) feeds for automated alerts and a suite of software tools to facilitate data processing and visualization.

## 1. RSS Feeds (Really Simple Syndication)

- **Overview:**  
  MOSDAC’s RSS feed service enables users to receive automatic updates when new data products are published on the portal.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Automated Notifications:** Users are alerted immediately upon the release of new satellite datasets or updated products (e.g., latest images, SST maps, rainfall data).
  - **Custom Subscriptions:** Feeds are categorized based on satellite missions and data types. Examples include:
    - SCATSAT-1 Wind Products RSS
    - INSAT-3D Imager RSS
    - INSAT-3DR Sounder RSS
  - **Accessibility:** Compatible with any standard RSS reader on web, desktop, or mobile platforms.

- **Applications:**  
  - Useful for meteorologists, disaster managers, and researchers who require timely awareness of data releases.
  - Enables integration with automated workflows for real-time processing or decision-making.

## 2. Software Tools and Utilities

- **Overview:**  
  To help users work with complex satellite data formats (like HDF5 or NetCDF), MOSDAC—through ISRO/SAC—offers recommended tools, format converters, and visualization applications.

- **Tool Categories:**
  - **Data Format Converters:**  
    - Convert satellite data from formats like HDF5 to simpler formats such as ASCII, CSV, or binary.  
    - Helps integrate satellite data with user-developed scripts or third-party models.

  - **Data Viewers and Visualizers:**  
    - Tools like HDFView, Panoply, or IDV plugins allow users to explore geophysical parameters and satellite imagery.  
    - Enables non-programmers to view and analyze data interactively.

  - **Atmospheric Correction Models:**  
    - Packages to correct radiometric measurements for atmospheric effects, improving accuracy for oceanographic and land studies.

- **Availability:**
  - Tools are generally available from the "Software" or "Tools" section of the [MOSDAC website](https://www.mosdac.gov.in), often accompanied by installation instructions and user manuals.

- **Applications:**
  - Facilitates research by easing the learning curve for working with remote sensing datasets.
  - Supports academic, operational, and commercial users in generating maps, profiles, and data summaries efficiently.
