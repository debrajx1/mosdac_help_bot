# Imager Data Products: Capturing Earth's Surface and Atmosphere

## Overview

Imager payloads onboard geostationary satellites like INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are multi-spectral radiometers designed to observe the full Earth disc across various spectral bands. These include:

- Visible (VIS)  
- Shortwave Infrared (SWIR)  
- Middle Infrared (MIR)  
- Water Vapour (WV)  
- Thermal Infrared (TIR)

These payloads enable continuous, high-frequency observation of meteorological and environmental conditions over the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions.

## Capabilities

- **High Temporal Resolution:** Imagery available every 30 minutes (or better), enabling near real-time tracking of weather systems.  
- **Multi-Spectral Sensing:** Detects features ranging from surface temperature and vegetation to cloud structures and water vapor content.  
- **Geostationary Coverage:** Provides uninterrupted observations from a fixed location, critical for monitoring evolving weather patterns.

## Key Applications

Imager-derived products support a wide range of operational and research activities:

- **Weather Forecasting:** Cloud cover monitoring, convective storm tracking, cyclone identification, and wind vector estimation.  
- **Disaster Management:** Early warning of severe weather events (e.g., thunderstorms, cyclones, heavy rainfall, fog, forest fires).  
- **Ocean Monitoring:** Sea Surface Temperature (SST) estimation and oceanic heat content studies.  
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Detection of aerosols, smoke, and pollution; land surface condition assessment (e.g., snow cover).  
- **Climate Studies:** Long-term data series for understanding atmospheric energy balance and surface radiation dynamics.

## Data Products and Levels

MOSDAC processes Imager data into various scientific products categorized by processing level:

- **Level-1:** Radiometrically calibrated and georeferenced brightness temperatures and reflectances.  
- **Level-2:** Derived geophysical parameters such as SST, Cloud Motion Vectors (CMV), Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE), and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR).  
- **Level-3:** Gridded and temporally composited datasets for climate analysis (e.g., daily/monthly averages of SST or cloud properties).

These products are available for download through the MOSDAC portal and are widely used by meteorological agencies, researchers, and global institutions.
