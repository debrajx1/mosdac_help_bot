# Key Imager Data Products: Sea Surface Temperature, Outgoing Longwave Radiation, and Quantitative Precipitation Estimation

## 1. Sea Surface Temperature (SST)

### Measurement
Sea Surface Temperature (SST) represents the temperature of the ocean's uppermost layer, derived primarily from the thermal infrared channels of geostationary Imager payloads.

### Significance
SST is a critical parameter in both oceanographic and meteorological studies. It influences global weather patterns, marine biodiversity, and energy exchange between the ocean and atmosphere.

### Applications
- **Oceanography:** Monitor ocean currents, detect upwelling/downwelling zones, and analyze marine heatwaves.
- **Meteorology:** Enhance weather prediction by improving air-sea interaction modeling and fog forecasting in coastal zones.
- **Fisheries:** Identify Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) where fish species tend to concentrate based on thermal preference.
- **Climate Studies:** Track long-term SST changes associated with climate variability (e.g., El Niño, La Niña).

### Resolution
Typical spatial resolution is 4 km × 4 km from geostationary satellites.

## 2. Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR)

### Measurement
OLR quantifies the thermal infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and atmosphere into space. It is computed using thermal infrared bands from the Imager.

### Significance
OLR is a key component of Earth's radiation budget. Lower OLR values usually correspond to thick, cold cloud tops and are indicative of deep convective activity.

### Applications
- **Climate Monitoring:** Evaluate regional and global energy balance and cloud feedback mechanisms.
- **Weather Forecasting:** Detect areas of intense convection and monitor tropical storm development.
- **Monsoon Studies:** Assess convective intensity and spatial distribution during monsoon seasons.

## 3. Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE)

### Measurement
QPE estimates rainfall rates using satellite-based cloud-top temperature and water vapor information, particularly from thermal infrared and WV channels of the Imager.

### Significance
QPE fills observational gaps in rainfall monitoring, especially in remote areas with few or no rain gauges.

### Applications
- **Hydrology:** Provide rainfall input for hydrological modeling and flood forecasting.
- **Disaster Management:** Enable flash flood alerts and drought assessment.
- **Agriculture:** Support crop yield estimation and irrigation planning.

### Resolution
Available as gridded products (e.g., 4 km × 4 km) with temporal resolutions like hourly or 3-hourly.
