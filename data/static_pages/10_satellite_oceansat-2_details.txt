# Oceansat-2: Advancing Indian Oceanographic Remote Sensing

## Mission Overview

Oceansat-2 was the second dedicated oceanographic satellite developed under ISRO’s Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) program. Designed to ensure continuity of services from its predecessor Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4), it incorporated enhanced capabilities for global ocean color monitoring, surface wind measurements, and atmospheric profiling.

The mission played a crucial role in supporting oceanographic research, coastal zone studies, marine ecosystem monitoring, and improving weather and climate modeling.

## Key Contributions

Oceansat-2 significantly advanced India’s capacity in space-based ocean and atmospheric monitoring. Its high-resolution data supported:

- Ocean primary productivity mapping  
- Detection of marine biological hotspots and potential fishing zones (PFZ)  
- Ocean current analysis and sea surface wind modeling  
- Improved weather and cyclone forecasting  
- Research in marine biogeochemistry and air-sea interactions  

Oceansat-2 data was widely adopted by national agencies, research institutions, and global scientific communities, reinforcing India’s role in operational oceanography.
