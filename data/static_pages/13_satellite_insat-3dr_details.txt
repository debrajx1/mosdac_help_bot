# INSAT-3DR: Enhanced Geostationary Meteorological Satellite for Continuity

## Mission Overview

INSAT-3DR is an advanced geostationary meteorological satellite launched by ISRO as a follow-on to INSAT-3D. It aims to ensure the continuity of vital weather and climate monitoring services while enhancing India’s capabilities in forecasting, disaster warning, and atmospheric research. INSAT-3DR retains the core meteorological payloads of its predecessor but with improved resolution and accuracy.
