# MOSDAC Data Applications in Disaster Management

The Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) supports India's disaster management framework by providing timely, satellite-based data essential for early warnings, real-time monitoring, and post-disaster assessments. These data products play a crucial role in safeguarding lives, minimizing damage, and enabling effective response and recovery operations.

## Key Disaster Management Applications

### 1. Tropical Cyclone Monitoring and Prediction

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Imager: Cloud imagery, Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR)  
  - Scatterometer: Ocean surface wind vectors  
  - Sounder: Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity

- **Contribution:**  
  Enables continuous monitoring of cyclone development, trajectory, and intensity. Scatterometer data is critical for detecting wind patterns over oceans, especially in the absence of in-situ measurements. These datasets feed into cyclone prediction models for timely warning dissemination to coastal communities.

### 2. Heavy Rainfall and Cloud Burst Alerts

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Imager: Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE), Cloud-top imagery  
  - Sounder: Humidity profiles, atmospheric stability indices (e.g., CAPE, Lifted Index)

- **Contribution:**  
  Helps identify atmospheric conditions favorable for extreme rainfall events and potential cloudbursts. The data supports flash flood modeling and urban flood alert systems.

### 3. Flood Monitoring and Impact Assessment

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Imager: Visible and Infrared imagery for water detection  
  - QPE: Rainfall accumulation data

- **Contribution:**  
  Supports mapping of flood-inundated areas, enabling near-real-time monitoring of flood extent and aiding relief and rehabilitation planning.

### 4. Drought Monitoring

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Imager: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), Land Surface Temperature (LST), QPE for rainfall anomalies

- **Contribution:**  
  Facilitates the detection of agricultural drought by analyzing vegetation stress and rainfall deficits. Useful for drought early warning systems and crop planning.

### 5. Forest Fire Detection and Monitoring

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Imager: Middle Infrared and Thermal Infrared channels

- **Contribution:**  
  Detects active fire zones and thermal anomalies. Tracks wildfire spread and severity, enabling rapid response and damage estimation.

### 6. Fog and Low Cloud Warning

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Imager: Visible, SWIR, and TIR channels (especially useful during night-time)

- **Contribution:**  
  Identifies and maps fog-prone regions, supporting safe navigation for aviation, road, rail, and maritime transport systems.

---

### 7. Snowmelt Runoff Forecasting

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Imager: Snow cover mapping using visible and infrared channels

- **Contribution:**  
  Provides information on snow extent and depth, crucial for modeling snowmelt-induced river flows. Supports flood risk assessment in Himalayan and other snow-fed river basins.
