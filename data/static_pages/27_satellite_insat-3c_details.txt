# INSAT-3C: A Communication Satellite with a Meteorological Imager

## Mission Overview

INSAT-3C was a multi-role geostationary satellite launched under the Indian National Satellite (INSAT) series. While primarily focused on communication, broadcasting, and telecommunication services, it was also equipped with a meteorological imager to support India's weather observation capabilities. The satellite’s meteorological data was archived by MOSDAC and used in operational weather analysis.

## Meteorological Payload

### Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR)

- **Function:**  
  A three-band radiometer for meteorological imaging, similar to those on Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A.

- **Spectral Channels:**
  - **Visible:** 0.55–0.75 µm  
  - **Thermal Infrared (TIR):** 10.5–12.5 µm  
  - **Water Vapour (WV):** 5.7–7.1 µm

- **Applications:**
  - Cloud pattern and motion tracking
  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST) estimation
  - Atmospheric water vapor profiling
  - Synoptic weather forecasting and regional weather monitoring

## Contributions

INSAT-3C played a supplementary role in India's space-based meteorological efforts. Though primarily a communication satellite, its VHRR instrument provided:

- Continuous cloud imagery and thermal data for operational weather monitoring
- Meteorological inputs that were archived and disseminated via MOSDAC
- Complementary observations to support the growing network of INSAT meteorological satellites

INSAT-3C helped maintain continuity of weather data and strengthened India’s integrated approach to satellite-based communication and meteorology.
