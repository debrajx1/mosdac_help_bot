## General Data Access and Usage Guidelines

1. **User Registration:**
   - Access to most operational and high-resolution satellite data requires user registration on the MOSDAC portal.
   - Registration helps track data usage and supports compliance monitoring.
   - Some datasets—such as quick-look imagery or preview products—are available without login.

2. **Primary Use for Research and Education:**
   - Data is intended primarily for **non-commercial** applications such as:
     - Academic research
     - Teaching and training
     - Public sector and governmental use
   - Redistribution or resale of raw data is **not permitted** unless explicitly authorized.

3. **Value-Added Products (VAPs):**
   - Users are encouraged to derive value-added products by integrating, processing, or analyzing MOSDAC data.
   - These VAPs may be distributed or published more freely, provided proper attribution is given.
   - Responsibility for the accuracy and validation of VAPs lies with the user.

4. **"As-Is-Where-Is" Basis:**
   - All data is provided without warranties or guarantees.
   - Users must validate the applicability and accuracy of data for their specific needs.
   - MOSDAC is not liable for errors or losses arising from the use of its datasets.

5. **Disaster Management Exception:**
   - Expedited access and broader sharing privileges are granted to authorized agencies involved in **disaster management**.
   - Such access may be coordinated with the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), SAC, or designated nodal agencies.

6. **Commercial Use:**
   - Commercial users seeking satellite data for business or industrial applications must:
     - Obtain approval through formal agreements with ISRO/SAC.
     - Abide by pricing, licensing, and redistribution terms specific to commercial use cases.
