# Megha-Tropiques: A Joint Indo-French Mission for Tropical Water Cycle Studies

## Mission Overview

Megha-Tropiques was a collaborative satellite mission between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the French Space Agency (CNES). It was specifically designed to study the atmospheric water cycle and the tropical energy budget. Its low-inclination orbit enabled frequent observations over the tropical belt (30°N to 30°S), making it highly effective for monitoring monsoons, tropical cyclones, and other convective weather systems. The mission's data was archived and disseminated through MOSDAC.

## Contributions

Megha-Tropiques provided unprecedented insights into the tropical atmospheric water and energy cycles, contributing significantly to:

- Detailed understanding of tropical rainfall distribution and intensity
- Analysis of atmospheric water vapor and its role in weather systems
- Monitoring of monsoon evolution and tropical cyclone development
- Improving climate and weather prediction models for the tropics

The data, especially from SAPHIR, was used in near real-time by international programs like the **GPM constellation**. MOSDAC played a central role in archiving and disseminating Megha-Tropiques data for both Indian and global users.
