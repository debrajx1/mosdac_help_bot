# SARAL-AltiKa: A Joint Indo-French Ocean Altimetry Mission

## Mission Overview

SARAL (Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa) is a collaborative oceanographic satellite mission between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the French Space Agency (CNES). Its primary goal is to perform satellite altimetry—precise measurements of sea surface height—using the advanced Ka-band AltiKa altimeter. These measurements are crucial for monitoring global sea level rise, ocean circulation, and mesoscale phenomena. The mission also carries an Argos payload for global data collection. Processed data from SARAL is archived and disseminated through MOSDAC.

## Payloads

### 1. AltiKa (Ka-Band Altimeter)

- **Function:**  
  Emits microwave pulses and measures the return time to calculate sea surface height with high accuracy.

- **Operating Frequency:**  
  Ka-band (35.75 GHz)

- **Advantages over Ku-band Altimeters:**
  - Higher vertical resolution
  - Reduced ionospheric and atmospheric signal delays
  - Enhanced measurement precision in open ocean

- **Applications:**
  - **Sea Surface Height Monitoring:** Tracking global and regional sea level trends
  - **Ocean Circulation:** Mapping eddies, gyres, and boundary currents
  - **Wave and Wind Observations:** Estimating significant wave height and surface wind speed
  - **Polar and Ice Monitoring:** Observing ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness
  - **Inland Water Studies:** Measuring water level changes in lakes, reservoirs, and large rivers

### 2. Argos Data Collection System (DCS)

- **Function:**  
  Receives and relays data from ground-based and oceanic platforms such as:
  - Ocean buoys
  - Argo floats
  - Animal tracking beacons
  - Meteorological stations

- **Applications:**
  - Supporting environmental research and biodiversity studies
  - Providing ground-truth for satellite-based climate and ocean observations
  - Enabling near real-time in-situ data acquisition for oceanographic and meteorological use
