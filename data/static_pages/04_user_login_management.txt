   - **Copy the entire hyperlink** and **paste it into a new browser tab**.
   - Do not click directly from some email clients, as it may not work properly.

4. **Reset Your Password**  
   You’ll be redirected to a page where you can set a **new password**.

## Change Password (After Login)

If you’re logged in and want to change your password:

1. **Access Your Profile**  
   - Go to **"My Account"** or **"Profile"** from the dashboard or menu.

2. **Go to the Password Section**  
   - Look for an option like **"Change Password"**.

3. **Enter Passwords**  
   - Input your **current password**.  
   - Enter your **new password** and **confirm it** by typing it again.

4. **Save Changes**  
   Click **"Update"** or **"Save"**. Your new password will be applied immediately.

## Best Practices

- Use strong, unique passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Update your password periodically.
- Keep your registered email up to date for smooth recovery.
