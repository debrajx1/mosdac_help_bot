# MOSDAC Data Processing Levels

## Overview

Satellite data undergoes a series of processing stages before it becomes usable for scientific or operational applications. MOSDAC classifies its data products based on standardized **processing levels**, which reflect the degree of transformation applied to the raw sensor output. Understanding these levels helps users select datasets appropriate to their analytical needs.

## Level-0 Data (Raw Data)

- **Description:**  
  Level-0 data represents the rawest form of satellite telemetry. It consists of instrument counts and binary streams directly reconstructed from the satellite downlink. These data are time-referenced but lack calibration, geolocation, or scientific interpretation.

- **Use Cases:**  
  Primarily used by instrument engineers and calibration experts. Rarely distributed to general users.

## Level-1 Data (Calibrated and Georeferenced)

- **Description:**  
  These products are derived from Level-0 data through radiometric and geometric corrections. Radiometric calibration converts raw counts into physical units (e.g., radiance or brightness temperature), while geometric corrections assign accurate spatial coordinates.

- **Common Sublevels:**  
  - **Level-1A:** Brightness temperature, geo-tagged in scan mode.  
  - **Level-1B:** Brightness temperature in grid mode, often orbit-wise.  
  - **Level-1C:** Geo-tagged and co-located brightness temperature product.

- **Use Cases:**  
  Useful for researchers requiring calibrated data inputs for their own geophysical algorithms or models.

## Level-2 Data (Geophysical Parameters)

- **Description:**  
  Level-2 data contains geophysical variables directly derived from Level-1 products. These include scientifically meaningful quantities related to the atmosphere, land, or ocean.

- **Examples:**  
  Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Chlorophyll-a, atmospheric profiles (temperature and humidity), wind vectors, aerosol optical depth.

- **Use Cases:**  
  Widely used in meteorology, oceanography, and environmental monitoring.

## Level-3 Data (Gridded and Composited Products)

- **Description:**  
  These products result from spatial and temporal aggregation of Level-2 data. They are projected onto regular grids and may involve compositing, averaging, or interpolation over time and space.

- **Examples:**  
  Daily SST maps, monthly chlorophyll composites, gridded rainfall datasets.

- **Use Cases:**  
  Suitable for climate analysis, regional modeling, and temporal trend studies.

## Level-4 Data (Model-Derived or Synthesized Products)

- **Description:**  
  Level-4 products are generated using models, assimilation techniques, or fusion of multiple datasets (satellite and in-situ). These provide the highest level of data synthesis.

- **Examples:**  
  Reanalysis datasets, modeled ocean current fields, wind vector synthesis.

- **Use Cases:**  
  Climate modeling, predictive analytics, and advanced scientific research requiring harmonized multi-source data.

## Summary

Understanding these processing levels is crucial for selecting the right dataset for your applicationâ€”whether you're conducting basic visualization, atmospheric modeling, or advanced geophysical research. MOSDAC provides products at all these levels depending on the mission, sensor, and user access tier.
